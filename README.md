# UniversalServer3

To make a plugin for Universalerver3 we now have a plugin template!

Download the template here https://moonbyte.net/download/universalserver/UniversalPluginTemplate.zip and then put it in your template folder. Project Templates is usually stored in the users documents files. For example C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\My Exported Templates drag that file into that folder and then when you create a new project there should be a UniversalPluginTemplate. I'll give a more detailed notice here later, expect a big update in the comming weeks.

All of my repos has been moved to my private repository. To contribute, please view https://repository.moonbyte.net/braydel/UniversalServer3

All of my repositories are still online, but I recently had a project where I needed branch protection and I was not willing to pay github for it.
